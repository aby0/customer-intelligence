  "executive_summary": "This call was between a sales rep and Nina, Head of Data at a 60-person analytics consulting firm, who had downloaded the company's attribution benchmarking report. The conversation centered on Nina's inability to accurately attribute marketing results across channels—particularly podcast sponsorships worth $180K annually—due to a manual, spreadsheet-based process that consumes two analyst-days per month and produces unreliable data. The core pain point is a \"dark funnel\" problem: prospects hear about the firm on podcasts but are misattributed to organic search, leaving the CEO without data to decide whether to scale or cut the podcast investment.\n\nNina raised two notable objections during the call. First, she pushed back on the self-reported attribution approach, citing poor data quality from a prior manual attempt with dropdown fields [turn 9]. The rep effectively addressed this by explaining the product's NLP-powered free-text approach and its 70-80% match rate with digital signals [turn 10]. Second, Nina flagged budget sensitivity and limited engineering resources [turns 11, 17], both of which were handled well—the rep positioned the $42K annual cost against the $180K podcast spend decision and confirmed that implementation requires only marketing ops, not engineering.\n\nThe deal is in strong shape. Nina expressed clear buying intent and stated she would recommend the purchase to her CEO, Alisha, with the goal of providing an answer by Friday [turn 25]. The rep committed to sending a proposal with two consulting-firm case studies by end of day. Implementation could begin as early as next Monday with a target go-live by end of March. The primary remaining hurdle is CEO approval, though Nina expressed confidence she can secure it independently.",

    "The prospect's confidence in self-reported attribution was damaged by a prior failed attempt; long-term trust in the NLP approach will depend on early results matching expectations",
    "Partner co-marketing attribution was mentioned as a channel but was not discussed in detail—unclear whether the product fully supports this use case, which could surface as a gap during evaluation",
    "Nina is championing this internally alone; if she encounters unexpected resistance or competing priorities from the CEO, there is no secondary internal advocate"
