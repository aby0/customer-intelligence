      "reasoning": "CFO David Chen consistently frames questions around de-risking the investment: confidence intervals on ROI assumptions, implementation support for technical issues, conservative payback calculations, and resource constraints. While cost reduction (345K savings) is important, his primary lens is ensuring the investment won't fail or drain resources. He needs multiple layers of assurance before committing. The hesitation markers and body language at closing (closed posture, minimal gesturing, resigned acceptance tone) further indicate this is a risk-averse buyer being pushed by champion pressure and rational argument rather than enthusiasm."
