However, a strong secondary model is risk mitigation — not in the compliance sense, but in the decision-risk sense. She is paralyzed by uncertainty around a $180K spend decision and explicitly values the ability to 'test the accuracy before we commit to changing our budget allocation.' Her ROI calculation in [13] blends both: time savings AND de-risking a major budget decision. She is not primarily framing this as a growth play (she never talks about scaling or revenue expansion) nor as pure cost cutting (she doesn't mention headcount reduction). The core anxiety is: 'I'm making consequential decisions with bad data and wasting time producing it.' That's efficiency + risk mitigation."

She wants to validate the tool against existing anecdotal evidence before committing to budget changes [21]. Every question is grounded in practical, data-informed reasoning. This is a textbook analytical evaluator."

However, she still needs to loop in her CEO and requests case studies for internal persuasion, which tempers this. She's more of an empowered evaluator than a top-down executive champion. The confidence is low because her dominant mode is analytical, not strategic-visionary."
