TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

Produce the following:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 paragraphs):
   - What was this call about? Who was involved?
   - What were the main discussion points, objections raised, and how they were handled?
   - What is the deal status and what are the next steps?
   Write in narrative prose, not bullet points.

2. KEY MOMENTS (3-5 turning points in the conversation):
   - Breakthroughs, objections, commitments, risks, or insights
   - Reference specific turn indices so the reader can find them
   - Explain why each moment matters for the deal

3. ACTION ITEMS:
   - Follow-up tasks with the responsible party (rep, prospect, or specific stakeholder name)
   - Rate criticality: high (blocks deal), medium (important), low (nice-to-have)

4. PROSPECT PRIORITIES (top 3-5):
   - What does the prospect care about most, based on what they said and asked?

5. CONCERNS TO ADDRESS:
   - Unresolved issues that could block or stall the deal
   - Include concerns that were implied but not explicitly stated
