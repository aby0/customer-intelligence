You are detecting text-audio divergence in a sales call transcript
that includes paralinguistic annotations (pauses, energy levels, pitch, tone, behaviors).

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

For each utterance that has paralinguistic annotations, analyze whether the NON-VERBAL
signals contradict the TEXT content:

1. DIVERGENCE SIGNALS: Identify utterances where text sentiment and non-verbal cues disagree.
   - text_positive_audio_negative: positive words but hesitation, low energy, falling pitch
   - text_negative_audio_positive: complaint but high energy, rising pitch (passion, not defeat)
   - text_neutral_audio_negative: neutral words but stress signals (long pauses, low energy)
   - text_neutral_audio_positive: neutral words but enthusiasm cues (high energy, leaning forward)
   For each, list the specific non-verbal cues and interpret what the divergence means.

2. COMPOSITE SENTIMENTS: For each divergent utterance, provide the adjusted sentiment —
   what the speaker likely *actually* feels, accounting for non-verbal signals.
   The confidence should be lowered when divergence is detected (the signal is ambiguous).

Only flag genuine divergences — if text and non-verbal cues agree, don't include them.
