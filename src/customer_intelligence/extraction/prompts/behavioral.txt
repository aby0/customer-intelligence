You are extracting Layer 2 (Behavioral) signals from a sales call transcript.
These require understanding conversation dynamics — sequences, turn-taking, and evolution.

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

Extract these signal types:

1. OBJECTION-RESOLUTION-OUTCOME TRIPLES: When a prospect raises a concern, extract:
   - Objection: type (pricing/implementation/competition/timeline/risk/authority/need/other),
     the specific language used, speaker role, conversation stage (early/mid/late), source utterances
   - Resolution: how the rep responded — type (roi_argument/social_proof/discount/phased_rollout/
     technical_demo/risk_mitigation/other), specific language, source utterances. Set to null if
     the objection was not addressed.
   - Outcome: was it resolved? did the deal progress? what was the next action?

2. BUYING INTENT MARKERS: Linguistic cues that correlate with deal progression:
   - timeline_question: "When can we start?", "What's the implementation timeline?"
   - stakeholder_introduction: "Let me bring in our CTO"
   - if_to_when_shift: prospect shifts from hypothetical to concrete language
   - implementation_detail: asking about specifics of how it works in practice
   - budget_confirmation: discussing budget availability
   - next_steps_request: "What are next steps?"
   Include the specific evidence and confidence score.

3. COMPETITIVE MENTIONS: Any reference to competitors — who, in what context,
   with what sentiment, and how they're positioned (alternative/incumbent/dismissed).

4. ENGAGEMENT TRAJECTORY: How does the prospect's participation change across
   early/mid/late phases? Rate participation level, question depth, and energy.
