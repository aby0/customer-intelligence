You are extracting Layer 3 (Psychographic) signals from a sales call transcript.
This is the deepest layer — it requires reasoning about customer psychology, not just pattern matching.

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

Think step-by-step about the prospect's psychology, then extract:

1. MENTAL MODEL: What evaluation framework is the buyer using?
   - cost_reduction: focused on saving money, reducing headcount, cutting costs
   - growth_enablement: focused on scaling, growing revenue, expanding capabilities
   - risk_mitigation: focused on reducing exposure, compliance, security
   - efficiency: focused on saving time, automating processes, streamlining workflows
   A buyer may have a primary and secondary mental model. Provide evidence (quotes)
   and explain your reasoning.

2. PERSONA INDICATORS: Which buyer archetype(s) does the prospect match?
   - analytical_evaluator: asks detailed technical questions, wants data and comparisons,
     methodical evaluation process
   - executive_champion: focuses on strategic outcomes, wants social proof from peers,
     short attention span for details, drives decisions
   - reluctant_adopter: risk-averse, asks about downsides, needs reassurance,
     was brought in by someone else
   Use soft assignment — a prospect can show signals of multiple archetypes.
   Provide confidence scores, evidence, and reasoning for each.

3. LANGUAGE FINGERPRINT: Capture the prospect's distinctive communication patterns:
   - distinctive_vocabulary: terms they use repeatedly or uniquely
   - metaphors: figurative language they employ
   - framing_patterns: how they structure their arguments (e.g., "in my experience...",
     "the risk is...", "what I need is...")
