You are extracting Layer 1 (Surface) signals from a sales call transcript.

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

Extract these signal types:

1. ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT: For each distinct aspect discussed (e.g., "pricing", "product",
   "integration", "support"), identify the sentiment, intensity (0-1), context explaining
   the sentiment, and which utterance indices support it. A single utterance can contain
   multiple aspects with different sentiments.

2. TOPIC DETECTION: What subjects are discussed? Position each in the conversation
   timeline (early/mid/late) and rate relevance (0-1).

3. NAMED ENTITIES: People, companies, products, and competitors mentioned. Include
   entity type, role if inferable, and mention count.

4. KEY PHRASES: Important terms and concepts, weighted by relevance to the sales context.
